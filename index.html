    <p>The app pulls data from wearable devices and fitness apps. It makes it easy for the user to understand their risk profile; it tracks insights and provides education and actionable recommendations. In addition, users will have access to health and wellness challenges, and a social layer will provide motivation, encouragement, and community.
    </p>
    <p>WellTree is not intended to replace one's doctor. Still, its goal is to empower them with more insights to engage their healthcare providers proactively. You can think of WellTree as a cross between Apple Health, Strava, and Insight Timer
