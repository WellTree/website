        <li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmorel/">Brian Morel</a> - </strong> A long-time endurance athlete, he became interested in wellness after being diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm brought on by a family history of hypertension/heart disease. Successfully treated with Open Heart Surgery in 2022, Brian saw first-hand the need for people to be more proactively engaged in their healthcare and to understand how wellness can impact heart health.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nir-sheep/">Nir Sheep</a> - </strong> Nir, a former combat medic in the Israel Defence Force, has expertise in biomedical engineering and has held various roles in healthcare technology companies including roles at Amazon, McKesson Technology Group, and Viz.ai, where he led teams and solved complex problems using modern technologies. Brian's inspiration is more personal in nature.</li>
